Looking at Basics of Components in React:
JSX:
- Javascript XML which allows you to write html code inside JS and converts HTML tags into React elements

Props vs State
- Props is short for properties which is similar to function's parameter and state is similar to declaring variables within a function.

- So main difference between Props and State is that props getting passed into a component while state is mananged within a component.


Conditional Rendering
- As the name suggests, display components based on a specific behaviour of a state using logical operators if required.

Composition vs Inheritance
- Two design patterns to reuse and combine code are Inheritance and Composition

- Inheritance has a base (parent) class which is further built upon by child classes. IT IS NOT ADVISED TO APPLY INHERITANCE TO REACT COMPONENTS

React is component based so that is recommended instead.
